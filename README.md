# app-skeleton
Scaffold for any new apps I write these days. This is an example of how to build great apps without having to use a framework like React or Angular

This Scaffold uses Typescript to enforce some typing, Webpack to bundle everything in an efficient manner, RxJs to bind events, and Inversify to do dependency injection. As it stands now, it does not support IE but could with the addition of Bable to the compile chain.
